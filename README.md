The repo was created as a sandbox folder to exercise python techniques. The following practice assignments can be found in the notesbooks folder:

1. wine classification - is it a red wine or white wine?

2. wine attributes analysis (variable exploration)

3. wine attributes clustering - what groups of a wines are similiarly composed and what is the wine quality of these groups?
